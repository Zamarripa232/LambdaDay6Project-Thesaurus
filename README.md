# Lambda Day 6 Project: Thesaurus
This project takes a users query in an EditText and compares it to a array of String[], each String[] is a list of words that are synonomous.
## Improvements
* The nested if statements aren't pretty but I was getting bored with this project and wanted it finished.
* It could search against a dictionary, or a larger array of words. Probably even scraping a website?
* More doge and kitty words.
